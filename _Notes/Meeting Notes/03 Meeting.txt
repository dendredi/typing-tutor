Questions:

- Thesis
	* method to formally "proove"/explain co- and contra-variance of subtyping of functions

- Parser problems:
	* Does not distingush between expressions for ArrayType and PointerType (both will be mapped to PointerType)
	* char extractInfo( struct{char info} ) not Supported. Must Define struct with name before.
	* Nested structs not supported, e.g.: struct list { int info; struct list* next }
	* Only valid struct type expression is e.g.:
		struct Test { int x; }
		struct Test y = { .x = 3};

		Not valid:
		- struct { int x; } y;
		- typedef struct { .x = 3 } Test;

		(Note: Within every declaration, initialization is required...)
		--> See example from lecture		
	* Take functions as parameter like so: void func ( void (*f)(int) );
		

- Currently: separation of code into "ast" and "typing" module --> would it be better to use abstraction TypExpression on respective ast nodes?
