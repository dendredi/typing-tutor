A. Goal (and blueprint) of the Tool
	* Goal of Typing (see screenshots, e.g.: manage memory, select correct assembler instruction, avoid certain run-time errors)
	* Goal of Tool (lerning by vizualization of ... a) Typing b) Structural Subtyping

B. Technical Decisions
	* Framework / Language
		- TypeScript (override and the --noImplicitOverride Flag)
        	- Angular Basics (directive examples, change detection)
	* Dependencies (e.g. monaco-code-editor, apache echart, cparse)
	* DevOps (CI/CD Pipeline: AWS, Docker, GitHub Actions,...)
	* Class Diagram (AstNode, TypeExpression, TypeEnvironment... ) 

C. Development Progress
    * New Features
	- Baseline: Integration of monaco, cparse and echarts (Realtime refresh by angular change detection)
	- Adding TypeEnvironment / Symbol Table
	- Adding performTypeCheck()
	- Vizualization by Typing tree (also: add type placeholder to always have full typing tree)
        - Replayable TypingTree- and Symbol Table-History (using Decorators)
    * Refactorings (Abstractions etc.)
        - Better display size allocation for TypingTree visualization (Add node width depending on number of children; add screenshots)

Not yet positioned:

- "Structural Subtyping"
	* Theory
		- Part 1: (Structural) Type Equality (Note: "equality is subset of subtyping") (Node: for previous features; equals was just easy string comp for testing purpose) (Note: does not hold in C)
		- Part 2: (Structural) Subtyping (e.g. co- and contra-variance of subtyping of functions -> explanation with subsets)
	* Proof of termination
	* Implementation in project
- New Featur: typedefs
	* Add AstNode "TypeDefStatement"
	* Add placeholder-type for it
	* Refactor: Add Typedefs to TypeEnvironment (idea: refactor to context holding all entities?)
	* Refactor: Add Typedefs as parameter to AbstractType::isStrutcturalSubtypeOf

- High Coupling/Low Cohesion
	* Theory (slides EIST, PSE)
	* Subsystems 'typing' and 'ast'
	* Callback pattern with dedicated interfaces
- User Experience
	* Only show AST of selected row (with cursor)?
