* Add CAST support
* separate BinOp in '=' and 'rest'
* TypingTreeComponen --> overflow?
* Fix type-environment constants!
* Check: does equality respect typedefs??
* struct names? (write in BA: omitted because irrelevant, deal with structural eq only)
* subtyping between pointers and arrays (specify in BA!)
(* Idee: Config mit enable/disbale structural subtyping check in typing tab)
(*Ask: termination subtyping --> what exactly does "declared types" mean?)
(*Reset structuralSubtypingBuffer at the end of the routine)
